2	kolch	English	2	Male	32	$5.00	Since I work in SLA and as a Chinese and Spanish translator, and since I majored in philosophy as an undergrad, I pretty quickly got most of the intent of the various exercises, as well as the invented terms&quotechar translations. To spare some of the repetitiveness of the initial exercises, it would be nice if there were some sort of confidence interval at which point one could escape the drills and simply provide the translation, since the syntax would probably be preserved once an adequate translation is provided.-NEWLINE_REMOVED--NEWLINE_REMOVED-I also would make a modification to my translation of "joidsy" to just mean "saucer," since it seems to function more like a noun adjunct than an adjective.	subj	Yes	joidsy	0
